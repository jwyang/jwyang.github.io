Hi, I am a senior researcher in [Deep Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group/) at Microsoft Research, Redmond, directed by [Dr. Jianfeng Gao](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jfgao/). My research interests span in computer vision, vision & language and machine learning. More specifically, my primary researches are about structured visual understanding at different levels and how to further leverage them for intelligent interactions with human through language and environment through embodiment. I believe, by integrating fine-grained structured information, we can achieve better yet interpretable, grounded and robust multi-modality intelligent agent.

Prior to joining Microsoft at March 2020, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from School of Interactive Computing at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) with thesis "Structured Visual Understanding, Generation and Reasoning". I was fortunte to be supervised by [Prof. Devi Parikh](https://cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/) and work closely with [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/).

My current main research focuses:

* **Developing effective and efficient architectures for encoding different modalities of inputs, particularly vision**. Along this direction, we have developed a series of vision encoders, such as [Vision Longformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15358), [Focal Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00641) and [FocalNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11926).
* **Building generalist multi-modal learning paradigm for the computer vision in the wild, and further for embodiment or robotics**. We are the first few teams in this line of research, and have produced a series of works, like [UniCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03610), [RegionCLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09106), [GLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03857), [KLITE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09222), and the foundation model [Florence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11432).

**If you are interested in working with me as a research intern on the above two topics, please feel free to drop me an email through jianwei.yang at microsoft dot com.**
